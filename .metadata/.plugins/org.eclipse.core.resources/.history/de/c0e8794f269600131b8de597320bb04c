/**
 * The increment/decrement operators can be applied before (prefix) or after (postfix) the operand. 
 * The code result++; and ++result; will both end in result being incremented by one. 
 * The only difference is that the prefix version (++result) evaluates to the incremented value, 
 * whereas the postfix version (result++) evaluates to the original value. 
 * If you are just performing a simple increment/decrement, it doesn't really matter which version you choose. 
 * But if you use this operator in part of a larger expression, the one that you choose may make a significant difference.
